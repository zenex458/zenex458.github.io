Briefly, the PATH is a system variable unique to UNIX systems which defines the hierarchy that the CPU uses to find executable binaries. If someone were to prepend or append a valid directory to the PATH, then the CPU would consider it as a valid location to find binaries in. Similarly, log files can be used as a vector for code execution if the permissions were to be misconfigured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SQL Injection</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_sqli/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sql-injection"&gt;SQL Injection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sql"&gt;SQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with databases and has the capability to delete, edit, insert or retrieve data. There are a few variations of SQL which have some slight syntactical differences. A few examples are MySQL, SQL Server and SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Twelvetide CTF</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_twelvetide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_twelvetide/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

The challenges can be found on CTFd and is strongly recommended to try to solve the challenges on your own before continue reading this article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="preparation-for-the-challenges"&gt;Preparation for the challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the following challenges will require you to send your already assembled code to the target; whose ip address and port is specified in the description of each challenge on CTFd.
The file &amp;lsquo;boilerplate.py&amp;rsquo; was kindly provided and its purpose is to help assemble your code, connect to the host and inject the payload; all you have to do it insert your assembly code where required and type the ip address and port number of the target inside the brackets of the p.remote() method.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Octalkber</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/octalkber/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/octalkber/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the month of October, for cybersecurity awareness month, each week we will be having a talk by someone in the cybersecurity field.

&lt;h2 id="warm-up---getting-help-in-the-terminal"&gt;Warm Up - Getting help in the Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever forgotten a command or switch in linux - here&amp;rsquo;s two great ways to find help; all from the comfort of your terminal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="help"&gt;&amp;ndash;help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually all commands in linux have built-in help, all you need to do is append &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; to the end of your command. So for help with nmap, you would use&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Week 1: OSINT Chalange Writeup</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/week1_writeup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:40:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/week1_writeup/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-week challenge covers the basics of OSINT research, opening remote connections and password cracking. I will try to cover most of the methods we can use to get through Jack&amp;rsquo;s cat and Ben&amp;rsquo;s secure passwords. Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="challenge-1-web-username"&gt;Challenge 1: Web Username&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was very tricky for me as I am not a cat person and don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy cat pictures&amp;hellip;
Anyway, as we go to the landing page, we can see that there are home(1) and login(2) pages and some information(3) about some employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduction, Recon &amp; OSINT Taster Session</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:14:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our first official session for the new academic year, it was great to finally meet you all in real life.
