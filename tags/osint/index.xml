I will try to cover most of the methods we can use to get through Jack&rsquo;s cat and Ben&rsquo;s secure passwords. Without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin.
Challenge 1: Web Username The first one was very tricky for me as I am not a cat person and don&rsquo;t enjoy cat pictures&hellip; Anyway, as we go to the landing page, we can see that there are home(1) and login(2) pages and some information(3) about some employees.]]></description></item><item><title>Introduction, Recon &amp; OSINT Taster Session</title><link>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:14:41 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://cov-comsec.github.io/posts/2021_taster_session/</guid><description>Welcome back to our first official session for the new academic year, it was great to finally meet you all in real life.
