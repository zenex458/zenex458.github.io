Briefly, the PATH is a system variable unique to UNIX systems which defines the hierarchy that the CPU uses to find executable binaries. If someone were to prepend or append a valid directory to the PATH, then the CPU would consider it as a valid location to find binaries in. Similarly, log files can be used as a vector for code execution if the permissions were to be misconfigured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
