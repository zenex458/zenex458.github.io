It was the first CTF of the year that ComSec
played, we had quite a few new members playing this one so it was a great chance for them to practice their skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article contains writeups of a range of difficulty and category, so this should be a good place for new members
to see what a jeopardy style CTF looks like.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
