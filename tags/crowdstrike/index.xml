CrowdStrike and ComSec request your help in identifying the malicious attackers. Can you help us identify the attackers before Warwick, Southampton and Edinburgh Napier do?
This week we will complete a blue team, security operation centre type challenge!
Unfortunately, places are limited this week, and require booking in advance - to book, view our post on either Aula or Discord
Who are CrowdStrike? &amp;lsquo;CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 to fix a fundamental problem: The sophisticated attacks that were forcing the worldâ€™s leading businesses into the headlines could not be solved with existing malware-based defences.</description></item></channel></rss>
