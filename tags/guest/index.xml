CrowdStrike and ComSec request your help in identifying the malicious attackers. Can you help us identify the attackers before Warwick, Southampton and Edinburgh Napier do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we will complete a blue team, security operation centre type challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, places are limited this week, and require booking in advance - to book, view our post on either Aula or Discord&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="who-are-crowdstrike"&gt;Who are CrowdStrike?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 to fix a fundamental problem: The sophisticated attacks that were forcing the world’s leading businesses into the headlines could not be solved with existing malware-based defences. Co-founders George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch realized that a brand-new approach was needed — one that combines the most advanced endpoint protection with expert intelligence to pinpoint the adversaries perpetrating the attacks, not just the malware.&amp;rsquo;
