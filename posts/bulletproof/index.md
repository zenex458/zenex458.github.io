# Bulletproof Event


Today, we will be having a talk by cybersecurity business Bulletproof.

The talk will include topics like what it is like to work in the security industry and the many different areas. Additionally, you will be able to talk to graduate students and have a chance to ask questions. Finally, the event will be capped off with a CTF!
